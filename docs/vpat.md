Manual verification was conducted to confirm automated findings and assess areas not fully covered by automated tools, including keyboard-only navigation, logical focus order, and visible focus indicators. Limited screen reader checks were performed using built-in platform tools to confirm proper labeling and semantic structure. Testing was conducted on **Google Chrome** for desktop.
